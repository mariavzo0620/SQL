#In this SQL code, I answered some questions about a database with multiple tables to assess customer and monthly sales data using queries.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID= customers.order_id;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP By product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
